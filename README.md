## Overview 

Building a multi-layer perceptron to try to classify handwritten digits using tensor flow.

The data was acquired from: [THE MNIST DATABASE](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

## Direction

I recommend to install tensor flow as a virtual environment via conda 
1. Install [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)  

2. download the dataset
3. split it into training and testing datasets
4. test the model
5. calculate the accuracy 

## Dependencies 

1. get the [input_data](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/input_data.py) py script and put it on your current working folder.
2. tensorflow 

## Purpose 

This is
